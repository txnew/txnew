## 




My name is Toni! I am a `undergraduate student` at UMGC studying `Cybersecurity Technology & Computer Science` on track to graduate in the `Fall of 2026`. 

I have a passion for continual learning and as a result, I'm always reading, listening to podcasts, and practicing my academic coursework through self-learning platforms to grow my understanding of core concepts. I do currently have a full-time position and balance a full-time courseload, so my progress on updating my work on GitHub and the self-learning platforms below is slow, but I actively make a point to practice coding throughout the week.

#### Currently, I am...
- 🎓 Learning how to design & implement data structures in Java (<a href="https://github.com/txnew/UMGC_Assignments">UMGC Assignments</a>)!
- 📜 Working towards a Responsive Web Design Certification on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/txnew">freecodecamp</a>!
- 🌱 Enrolled in Ethical Hacking - practicing application through <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/p/txnew">TryHackMe</a> & <a href="https://txnew.carrd.co/#htbacademy">HTB Academy</a>!
- 🏃 Applying for internships in Summer 2025, Winter 2025, and Summer 2026.
- 📫 Available for questions and general discussion at: <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/txnew/">LinkedIn</a>!!
